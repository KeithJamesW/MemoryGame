# Memory Game

This Javascript application allows for users to participate in a game with cards that are first rendered blank, but have a randomized color property that is displayed when the card element is clicked upon. After a pair is chosen and the two colors are revealed, they return to blank. The participant must remember where the pairs of the same colors reside on the board so that they can pair them together. The game is completed when each pair is found.
